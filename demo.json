It is hard not to know about Chittorgarh Fort which is a hilltop hill that became the symbol of Rajput culture, a massive structure that saw the history and sacrifices of heroes of Rajput times. One can also see the seven gates throughout the 700-acre fort, each with their own names: Padan Gate, Ganesh Gate, Hanuman Gate, Bhairon Gate, Jodla Gate, Lakshman Gate, and Lord Ram Gate. Also known as the Water Fort, it is often targeted due to the strategic location of the fort that made it almost impenetrable. At the same time, there are many palaces and life inside the fort is comfortable as it contains 84 bodies of water and 22 of them still exist today.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot to see inside the fort and we\u2019ll visit some of them. The Padmini Palace is a white building from the 19th century where Rani Padmini lived after marrying Rawal Ratan Singh in 1300 CE. Another palace is the Rana Kumbha Palace near the entrance gate, by the Victory Tower \u201cVijay Stambha.\u201d. The Fateh Prakash Palace inside the fort has been converted into a museum that houses a range of ancient artifacts in the form of old coins, sculptures and other crafts. The 8th century Kalika Mata Temple still stands inside the fort with new parts added much later. The Meera Bai Temple is another old Hindu temple dedicated to Meera Bai who was a devotee of Lord Krishna. Another notable tower is the Kirti Stambha from the 12th century by a Jain merchant to celebrate Jainism. It features fantastic sculptures of Hindu deities and stores from the Ramayana and Mahabharata.\r\n\r\nAfter the fort, it\u2019s time to explore the nature of this land by visiting Bassi Wildlife Sanctuary. This is a wildlife sanctuary with dry forests that are natural habitats for Dhok, Churel, Butea, wild cats, civets, hyenas, foxes, Chitals, and more. We can ride through the sanctuary to see the Bassi and Orai Dams that formed reservoirs where animals frequently visit for water.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll ride back to the hotel in the evening for your overnight stay in Udaipur.",

We start from the center of the temples, the sacred Pushkar Lake, that\u2019s believed to have medicinal properties for those who bath in one of the 52 bathing ghats. We\u2019ll also be visiting the number of temples out of the hundreds that dot the surrounding of the lake. Rangji Temple is a temple dedicated to Lord Vaikuntha Venkatesh or Lord Rangji, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. One of the most visually satisfying temples is the Man Mahal which features impressive Rajasthani architecture which also have gorgeous views of another nearby sacred lake. This palace cum hotel was built by Raja Man Singh I of Amber meant to serve as a temporary stay for his guests and himself when visiting Pushkar. Finally, we\u2019re not going to miss the main attraction of Pushkar, the Temple of Lord Brahma, also known as Jagatpita Brahman Mandir, one of the rare, ancient temples dedicated to the Hindu Creator God. Then visit one last gorgeous pilgrimage site, Savitri Temple, which is dedicated to the Goddess Savitri.
